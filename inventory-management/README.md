   - Vehicle master records
   - Inventory status tracking
   - Cost and pricing information
   - Location management

2. **Inventory Service Layer**
   - Vehicle data validation
   - Inventory business logic
   - Integration with external systems
   - Event publishing for inventory changes

3. **Inventory API**
   - RESTful endpoints for inventory operations
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and caching

4. **Inventory UI Components**
   - Inventory dashboard
   - Vehicle detail pages
   - Inventory search and filtering

## Workflows

### New Vehicle Acquisition Workflow
1. Enter/import basic vehicle information
2. Decode VIN for detailed specifications
3. Record acquisition costs
4. Assign initial location
5. Schedule reconditioning if needed
6. Set pricing strategy
7. Upload images and documents
8. Publish to website/marketplaces

### Inventory Aging Management Workflow
1. System identifies aging inventory based on configurable thresholds
2. Automated alerts sent to inventory manager
3. Price analysis shown with market comparison
4. Manager selects action (price reduction, feature promotion, wholesale)
5. System implements action and tracks results

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access with specific inventory permissions
- Cost data restricted to authorized personnel
- Audit logging of all inventory changes
- Secure API access for external system integration

## Performance Requirements
- Support for dealerships with 1,000+ vehicles in inventory
- Sub-second search results for inventory queries
- Real-time inventory updates across all channels
- Efficient handling of high-resolution images

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for optimal inventory mix recommendations
- Predictive analytics for price depreciation curves
- AR/VR integration for virtual inventory tours
- Blockchain for immutable vehicle history records

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use of indexing for fast inventory search
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed inventory data
- Image optimization and CDN integration
- Batch processing for inventory feeds
- Real-time and batch synchronization options for marketplace listings
