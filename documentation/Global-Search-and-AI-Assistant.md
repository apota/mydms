## Global Search

### Overview

The Global Search feature provides users with a unified search experience across all DMS modules (Inventory, Parts, CRM, Sales, Service, Reporting, and Financial Management). This allows users to quickly find information without navigating to specific modules.

### User Interface

The Global Search is accessible from any page in the DMS via a search icon (🔍) in the top navigation bar. When clicked, it expands to a search interface:

```

+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Search Results Interface

When search results are returned, they are categorized by module for easy navigation:

6. **Advanced Indexing**: Full-text search with typo tolerance
7. **Search History**: Save and access previous searches
8. **Contextual Awareness**: Results prioritized based on user's role and current module

### Technical Implementation

The Global Search will be implemented using:
- Elasticsearch for fast indexing and retrieval
- Redis for caching recent searches
- REST API endpoints for searching across all modules
- React components for UI implementation
- Debounced typing for real-time suggestions

## AI Assistant - Rudy

### Overview

Rudy is an AI assistant integrated into the DMS that helps users with cross-module tasks, data integration, and complex workflows. Rudy learns from user interactions and provides intelligent assistance tailored to the dealership operations.

### User Interface

Rudy is accessible from any page via a dedicated AI assistant icon (🤖) in the top navigation bar. When minimized:

```

```

### Data Access Patterns

1. **Read-Only Access**: Both features primarily use read-only access to modules
2. **Write Actions**: Any write operations initiated through Rudy are performed through proper module APIs with appropriate permissions
3. **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed data is cached for performance
4. **Permission Awareness**: Results and actions respect user's role-based permissions

### Complex Cross-Module Task Example

Example: User needs to identify customers with service history but no recent sales activity

**Without Global Search/Rudy**:
1. Navigate to Service Management
2. Extract list of frequent service customers
3. Navigate to Sales Management
4. Search for each customer to check sales history
5. Manually compile list of customers with service but no sales
6. Navigate to CRM
7. Create marketing campaign for these customers

**With Global Search/Rudy**:
1. Ask Rudy: "Show customers with service visits in the last 6 months but no sales in the last year"
2. Rudy provides the list, already analyzed
3. User asks Rudy to "Create a marketing campaign for these customers in CRM"
4. Rudy initiates the campaign creation process with the list pre-populated

## Additional Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Both features use asynchronous loading to maintain UI responsiveness
2. **Privacy & Security**: All data access respects user roles and permissions
3. **Offline Support**: Limited functionality when offline with sync when connection is restored
4. **Accessibility**: Both features meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Interfaces adapt to mobile and tablet screens
