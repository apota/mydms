# Parts Management Module Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Parts Management module is a critical component of the Automotive Dealership Management System (DMS), responsible for managing the dealership's parts inventory, suppliers, orders, transactions, and core tracking. This document provides an overview of the module's architecture, components, and functionality.

## Architecture

The Parts Management module follows a clean architecture approach with the following layers:

1. **Core Layer** - Contains domain models, DTOs, interfaces, and service contracts.
2. **Infrastructure Layer** - Contains implementations of services and repositories.
3. **API Layer** - Contains REST API controllers that expose the module's functionality.
4. **Tests** - Contains unit tests for services and controllers.

## Key Components

### Models

- **Part** - Represents a part in the inventory system.
- **PartInventory** - Represents the inventory levels of a part at a specific location.
- **Supplier** - Represents a parts supplier.
- **PartOrder** - Represents an order for parts from a supplier.
- **PartTransaction** - Represents inventory movements (issues, returns, adjustments, transfers).
- **PartCoreTracking** - Represents the tracking of cores (rebuildable components).

### Controllers

1. **PartsController** - Manages CRUD operations for parts, search, and vehicle fitment.
2. **InventoryController** - Manages inventory levels, locations, and adjustments.
3. **SuppliersController** - Manages CRUD operations for suppliers and related parts.
4. **OrdersController** - Manages the ordering process from creation to receipt.
5. **TransactionsController** - Manages inventory movements and history.
6. **CoreTrackingController** - Manages the tracking of cores through their lifecycle.

### Services

1. **PartService** - Implements business logic for parts management.
2. **InventoryService** - Implements business logic for inventory management.
3. **SupplierService** - Implements business logic for supplier management.
4. **OrderService** - Implements business logic for the ordering process.
5. **TransactionService** - Implements business logic for inventory transactions.
6. **CoreTrackingService** - Implements business logic for core tracking.

### Repositories

1. **PartRepository** - Data access for parts.
2. **PartInventoryRepository** - Data access for inventory.
3. **SupplierRepository** - Data access for suppliers.
4. **PartOrderRepository** - Data access for orders.
5. **PartTransactionRepository** - Data access for transactions.
6. **PartCoreTrackingRepository** - Data access for core tracking.

## Workflows

### Parts Management

- Create, update, and delete parts
- Search parts by various criteria
- Get part details and related information
- Manage vehicle fitment information
- Track supersessions and similar parts

### Inventory Management

- Track inventory levels across multiple locations
- Set minimum and maximum quantity thresholds
- Adjust inventory quantities
- Move inventory between locations
- Generate low stock reports

### Supplier Management

- Create, update, and delete suppliers
- Search suppliers by name or other criteria
- View parts supplied by each supplier
- Track supplier performance metrics

### Order Management

- Create purchase orders
- Add/remove lines from orders
- Submit orders to suppliers
- Track order status
- Receive complete and partial shipments
- Generate reorder recommendations

### Transaction Management

- Issue parts to service orders, customers, etc.
- Process returns of parts
- Adjust inventory quantities
- Transfer parts between locations
- View transaction history

### Core Tracking

- Track cores through their lifecycle (sold, returned, credited)
- Process core returns
- Apply credits for returned cores
- Track outstanding core value

## Security

Role-based access control is implemented throughout the module:

- **PartsManager** - Full access to all functions
- **PartsSales** - Limited to sales-related functions
- **ServiceAdvisor** - Limited to service-related functions
- **Admin** - Full access to all functions

## Integration Points

The Parts Management module integrates with other modules in the DMS:

1. **Service Management** - For issuing parts to service orders
2. **Sales Management** - For parts sales and accessories
3. **Financial Management** - For accounting and pricing information
4. **Reporting & Analytics** - For business intelligence

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests are provided for:
1. All service implementations
2. All controller implementations

## Future Enhancements

1. Barcode/QR code scanning for inventory management
2. Mobile application for physical inventory counts
3. EDI integration with major suppliers
4. AI-driven demand forecasting
5. Integration with third-party catalog systems

## Deployment

The module is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and scaling. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is provided using Terraform for cloud deployments.

## Conclusion

The Parts Management module provides a comprehensive solution for managing the parts operations of an automotive dealership. It is designed with flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in mind, following industry best practices for software architecture and design.
