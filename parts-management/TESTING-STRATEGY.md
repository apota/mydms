# Parts Management Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Parts Management module of the Automotive Dealership Management System (DMS). The strategy covers different levels of testing to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the module.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.

#### Coverage
- **Service Classes**: All public methods in service implementations
- **Controllers**: All API endpoints and their response types
- **Repository Methods**: Core functionality of repository implementations

#### Tools
- xUnit for test framework
- Moq for mocking dependencies
- FluentAssertions for readable assertions

#### Key Test Areas
- PartService
- InventoryService
- SupplierService
- OrderService
- TransactionService
- CoreTrackingService
- All Controllers

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different components of the module work correctly together.

#### Coverage
- **Service-Repository Integration**: Tests service classes with actual repository implementations
- **API-Service Integration**: Tests controllers with actual service implementations
- **Database Integration**: Tests repositories with test database

#### Tools
- xUnit for test framework
- TestContainers for database testing
- WebApplicationFactory for API testing

#### Key Test Areas
- Database operations
- Query performance
- Transaction integrity
- End-to-end API flows

### Performance Testing

Performance tests verify that the module meets performance requirements under various conditions.

#### Coverage
- **Load Testing**: System behavior under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: System behavior under peak load
- **Endurance Testing**: System behavior over extended periods

#### Tools
- JMeter for load testing
- Azure Load Testing for cloud-based testing

#### Key Test Areas
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Concurrent operations
- Memory usage

### Security Testing

Security tests verify that the module is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Coverage
- **Authentication**: Verify role-based access control
- **Authorization**: Verify permission enforcement
- **Input Validation**: Verify protection against injection attacks
- **Data Protection**: Verify sensitive data handling

#### Tools
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- SonarQube for static code analysis

#### Key Test Areas
- API endpoint security
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Data integrity controls

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Sources
- **Mock Data**: Generated for unit tests
- **Sample Data**: Predefined dataset for integration tests
- **Production-like Data**: Anonymized production data for performance testing

### Data Refresh Strategy
- Unit tests use freshly generated data for each test run
- Integration tests reset the test database before each test run
- Performance tests use persistent data that is reset periodically

## Automated Testing

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- Unit tests run on every pull request
- Integration tests run on merge to development branch
- Performance tests run on merge to release branch

### Test Monitoring
- Code coverage reports generated after each test run
- Test results published to team dashboard
- Performance metrics tracked over time

## Manual Testing

### Exploratory Testing
- Performed by QA team on each release candidate
- Focuses on user workflows and edge cases
- Results documented and tracked in issue management system

### User Acceptance Testing
- Performed by stakeholders before production release
- Validates that the module meets business requirements
- Sign-off required before production deployment

## Testing Environments

### Development Environment
- Used for unit and basic integration testing
- Local database with sample data
- Refreshed on demand

### Testing Environment
- Used for comprehensive integration testing
- Shared database with consistent test data
- Refreshed weekly

### Staging Environment
- Used for performance and user acceptance testing
- Production-like data and configuration
- Refreshed monthly

## Test Documentation

### Test Plans
- Detailed test plans for each major feature
- Coverage matrix mapping requirements to test cases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Test Reports
- Automated test reports from CI/CD pipeline
- Manual test result documentation
- Performance test analysis reports

### Issue Tracking
- All identified defects logged in issue management system
- Severity and priority assigned to each defect
- Regression testing performed on all fixed defects

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures the Parts Management module meets quality, reliability, and performance requirements. The combination of automated and manual testing across multiple environments provides confidence in the module's functionality and resilience.
